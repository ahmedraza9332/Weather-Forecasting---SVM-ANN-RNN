# Weather Forecasting — SVM, ANN, RNN

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using three machine learning models: **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**. It explores how traditional and deep learning techniques can be applied to forecast weather more accurately.

## 🚀 Models Used

- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Suitable for classification problems using historical weather data features.
- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**: Multi-layer perceptron trained on meteorological data.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: Ideal for sequential weather data (e.g., temperature time series).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes historical weather records such as:

- **Temperature** (°C/°F)
- **Humidity** (%)
- **Wind Speed** (km/h or mph)
- **Precipitation** (mm or inches)
- **Pressure** (hPa or mmHg)
- **Date & Time** features

## 🔍 Results

Each section of the notebook evaluates its respective model using:

- **Accuracy** - Overall prediction correctness
- **Confusion Matrix** - Classification performance visualization
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) - For regression-based predictions
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) - Average prediction error
- **R² Score** - Coefficient of determination

Graphs and metrics are included for performance comparison between all three models.
